This project sprint takes data from the college api and returns and prints out the data from the instructed fields into a text file.

# MMillerProjectSprint2

This sprint takes data from the college api and saves it into a database program. 
The ran into a couple of issues with syntax in main.py and i have one written, but not run test for the db.
Will look to get issues fixed for sprint 3

# MMillerProjectSprint3

The sprint is supposed to read from a new data file and allow it to be accessed and put into the database based on state information.
I was unable to make second table as there also seems to be some issues creating the db file. 
I was trying to base it off of your file as well as looking at peer screenshots on slack.
I also added a requirements file
I hope to have a cleaner and complete sprint 4
